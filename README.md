CodeLouisville SW dev 1 project

So you may have noticed many fialed attempts of programming a bot in this repository. I didn't upload these in order and some times my computer crashed while making 
changes to the UI and I lost my code TWICE. Lesson learned. If you program a button in c# and try to compile and run but then go back and try to delete or edit the 
button everything will break and 99% chance of you losing your code. My inital goal was to create a bot or web scraper to find the best price for a flight that the user
would input. Going through the motions and learning how to program the application to take what you type and autofill a website and click the sumbit button took countless hours. But I came to a road block I didn't even think of when starting this project. The infamous "Are you human" check. I quickly learned most websites you
use to book your flights have some sort of bot protection so maybe people with the same idea as me couldn't get a 20$ flight to California. So this is where I pivoted this project and taking a new approach using same core concept of trying to find a good deal. I still wanted to make a Web Scraper of some sort so I settled on making a 
scraper that will go through a listing on Ebay and show you all of the prices for the item that I want and give you a direct link to this item so that you can purchase 
it. Using various youtube tutorials, the help of mentors, and trusty StackOverflow and you have my project. A Web Scraper that helps you get a good deal.
