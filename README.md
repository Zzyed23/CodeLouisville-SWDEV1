# ps5ScraperBot

Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application (Instead of a file I am using a Website).

Web Scraper parsing through data in the html.

Analyze text and display information about it.

Information about what item it is, how much it costs, and a direct link so you can purchase it.
